## Overview
This project implements a **manufacturing assistant chatbot** that can handle queries from operators, supervisors, and suppliers. The bot remembers previous conversations using **LangChain's `ConversationBufferMemory`** and logs all chat exchanges in a **JSON file** for persistent records. The chatbot is powered by **Groq LLaMA 3.1 8B Instant** model and uses **Gradio** for an interactive web interface.
